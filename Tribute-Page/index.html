    <p>
      <b>1856:</b> Nikola Tesla was born to a serbian family in Smiljan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1875:</b> Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have
      graduated, but the institution disagrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1882:</b> Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used
      today in alternators.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1884:</b> Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of
      introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1885:</b> After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting
      his own electrical company.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1886:</b> Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented
      and marketed an arc lamp, however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1891:</b> In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that
      produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1915:</b> On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with
      radio transmission, however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1934:</b> In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially
      successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1943:</b> On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his
      death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1960:</b> In 1960, the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of
      measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.
